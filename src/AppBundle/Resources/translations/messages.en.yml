    Oh... Internet Explorer, though for some reasons really is a popular browser, often cannot deliver to the users
    everything that website developers want them to see. As a rule of thumb, in some cases we recommend installing
    another browser, which could perform better to make your web surfing more comfortable and satisfying.

    We strongly recommend that you remove the old version before installing the new one, but don't forget to save your

    Despite the fact that browser nowadays learned to update themselves without bothering users, older version of
    such software still in use by many people. As a result, for old browser versions owners websites and systems
    may perform and look differently then it was intended by it's developers. Do not spoil your impression - just
    always use the latest browsers versions

    browser version and could easily update it to see your project the way they should be - join up!
  guide:
    title: You can get data type you need
    html:
      title: Out of the box <span class="sSize">HTML5</span> widget
      title_short: HTML widget
      text: >
        With provided %jsLink% and simplest integration you will get neutrally styled widget, ready to be embedded
        on any of your website page. If the users browser version is outdated, the widget will show itself to propose
        an update. Don't be afraid to seem intrusive: if user declines once, he will see the widget no longer
      step:
        1: >
          Insert reserved block for output right after opening <code class="sSize">&lt;body&gt;</code> tag
          on page that should display the widget
        2: >
          Plug in the script file and initialize it before closing <code class="sSize">&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag
          on the same page
        3: >
          Specify the last parameter in script initialization link as widget display language, among those which
          are supported by Br.Asst., for example
        final: >
          Done!
    json:
      title: Required data in <span class="sSize">JSON</span> format
      title_short: Data in JSON
      text: >
        You can get only the necessary data to use it as you see fit. Object will contain information gathered from
        client's User-Agent, as well as the client browser version and boolean value that shows whether it's outdated
        or up to date. In case if browser is not detected or unsopported on user's operating system, we'll additionaly
        send a warning strind identifier
      step:
        1: >
          In order to get the response from Br.Asst. in JSON format you'll have to make a CORS GET request at
          <code class="sSize">https://brasst.com/api/{locale}</code> with additional GET parameter
          <code class="sSize">'type=json'</code>. The link's last parameter {locale} specifies your preferred language
          for errors and warnings output which is supported by Br.Asst., for example:
        2: >
          Received object will look similar to this:

      If you're experiencing difficulties with HTML-widget embedding or cross-origin request for JSON,
      please, refer to the detailed parameters description and examples on our GitHub repository

user_error_is_bot: >
  Unfortunately it was not possible to detect your browser, because it looks like you're a robot
user_error_is_mobile: >
  Unfortunately it was not possible to detect your browser, because Br.Asst. is not yet supporting mobile devices
user_error_not_browser: >
  Unfortunately it was not possible to detect your browser, because it looks like your client is not a web browser

nevermind_the_user_error: despite that, we hope that you can still find here something interesting

user_warning_unsupported_browser: >
  Unfortunately Br.Asst. is supporting only major browsers for now,
  and it can't tell anything about latest version of yours, or offer an update
user_warning_unsupported_os: >
  The browser you're using is not officially supported by your operating system.
  Why do you need a program which is abandoned by it's own developers? It's time to download and install another browser!
