      title: Out of the box <span class="sSize">HTML5</span> widget
      title_short: HTML widget
      text: >
        With provided %jsLink% and simplest integration you will get neutrally styled widget, ready to be embedded
        on any of your website page. If the user’s browser version is outdated, the widget will show itself to propose
        an update. Don't be afraid to seem intrusive: if user declines once, he will see the widget no longer
      step:
        1: >
          Plug in the script file before closing <code class="sSize">&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag on page that should
          display the widget:
        2: >
          Initialize the script right after inclusion. Additionally you can specify the widget display language, which
          is supported by Br.Asst., by passing an object with 'locale' parameter into the constructor function:
        final: >
          Done!
    json:
      title: Required data in <span class="sSize">JSON</span> format
      title_short: Data in JSON
      text: >
        You can get only the necessary data to use it as you see fit. Object will contain information gathered from
        client's User-Agent, as well as the client browser version and Boolean value that shows whether it's outdated
        or up to date. In case if browser is not detected or is not supported on user's operating system, we'll additionally
        send a warning string identifier
      step:
        1: >
          In order to get the response from Br.Asst. in JSON format you'll have to make a CORS GET request at
          <code class="sSize">https://brasst.net.ua/api</code> with additional parameter
          <code class="sSize">'type=json'</code>:
        2: >
          Received object will look similar to this:
        final: >
          You can work with the data now!

      If you're experiencing difficulties with HTML-widget embedding or cross-origin request for JSON,
      please, refer to the detailed parameters description and examples on our GitHub repository

user_warning_unsupported_browser: >
  Unfortunately Br.Asst. is supporting only major browsers for now,
  and it can't tell anything about latest version of yours, or offer an update
user_warning_unsupported_os: >
  The browser you're using is not officially supported by your operating system.
  Why do you need a program which is abandoned by its own developers? It's time to download and install another browser!
