  explorer: >
    Oh... Internet Explorer, though for some reasons really is a popular browser, often cannot deliver to the users
    everything that website developers want them to see. As a rule of thumb, in some cases we recommend installing
    another browser, which could perform better to make your web surfing more comfortable and satisfying.

    It could be that Br.Asst. is wrong, and you are actually using another browser, or it has another version.
    We would be very grateful if you'll provide feedback in this case.
  uninstall_browser: >
    We strongly recommend that you remove the old version before installing the new one, but don't forget to save your
    browsing data first (most of the modern browsers do offer such option)
